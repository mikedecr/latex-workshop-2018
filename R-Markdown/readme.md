# Workflow example (R Markdown version)

This sub-directory acts as a mock project for an R Markdown report. You should treat the `R-Markdown` directory as a project root. 

- it contains a `.Rproj` file for directory management. (Recommended that newcomers use RStudio to knit the document)
- `data` folder is contained within the project directory, so references to data are self-contained within the project.
