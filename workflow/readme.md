# Workflow example

This sub-directory acts as a mock project. You should treat the `workflow` directory as a project root. 

- it contains a `.Rproj` file and a `.here` file for directory management.
- `data` folder is contained within the project directory, so references to data are self-contained within the project.
- output is saved into a `tex` folder, which contains the `tex` document, bibliography file, and statistical output
