# Day 1

Slides (hurry)

Hello, world

- TeXMaker
- class
- environment
- hello
- build
  + build files
  + output directory?

Handout

- packages
- title (do it ourselves)
- sections
- margins
- spacing
- comments
- just point out:
  + footnotes
  + lists
  + typeface, size, style
- quote marks
- hyphens
- point out:
  + special characters
- Floats
  + tell them to read this carefully
  + include graphics, set width of figure 
    * (6in width in R is good, try to match the text size)
  + table example


Reiteration of philosophy

- content control, not stylistic intervention
  + if intervention, make it global
  + avoid bloat
  + tex is verbose enough
- workflow integration
  + statistical output (tables, figures)
  + save quantities (stats, p-values)


Next week transition

- workflow details are next week
- also beamer and bibliographies
- content control is more than TeX
  + Rmd, integrate your paper and your analysis
  + slideshows that run on R-Markdown (beamer sucks!)




# Workflow contents

- bibliographies
- figures
- tables
- referenced quantities


# Beamer

Don't spend too much time here

- it's a document class
- options for changing style and colors (look those up)
- frames, `only<x-y>`
- the rest is just tex


# Rmd

- Same as workflow but in Rmd
- links to other Rmd references
  + code chunks
  + cites
  + referenced quantities
